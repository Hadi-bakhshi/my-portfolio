Instead of relying on a traditional database, the project uses the file system for data storage, reading and writing files directly to manage CRUD operations. This approach not only simplifies setup but also introduces an alternative method of handling data persistence. The application provides a clear and practical example of integrating a backend with advanced TanStack Query concepts, making it an effective teaching tool for exploring modern front-end and backend development patterns.",
